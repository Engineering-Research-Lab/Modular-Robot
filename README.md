## Overview

The Modular Robot Head is an innovative, artistic, and industrially designed robotic module that features advanced control algorithms, mechanical engineering, and electronic assembly. It is designed with a transparent face capsule and plastic casing, incorporating a bicolor LED square pixel matrix for displaying emotions and reactions through eyes, nose, and mouth animations.

## CBM Control Bot Mechanism

The robot's control mechanism delivers a unique and engaging user experience, suitable for educational, therapeutic, and human-robot interaction research settings. Combining software and mechanical R&D, this initiative targets tailored solutions for therapeutic approaches such as Robot-Assisted Therapy/Training (RAT), addressing psychological and neurological conditions. The CBM robot head aims to explore educational and therapeutic applications through human-machine interaction.

## Operating System Application Software Library Interface

The Humanoid Robot software and device is a tool for interactive training and conversation. It is composed of a chat-bot interface and a humanoid robot control mechanism, which includes a cervical motility device for speech motion and facial detection/recognition. Its robot control mechanism provides a unique and engaging experience for users, making it well-suited for use in educational and therapeutic settings, as well as for human-robot interaction research.

## Functionality

The CBM project presents a modular robot head capsule prototype with facial interactivity functions. It comprises control software and a library of functions for a humanoid robot device.

The CBM software and device facilitate interactive conversation via AI chatbot and artificial conversational entities, offering flexibility for adoption with existing chatbots and AI NLP systems like ChatGPT, primarily serving as an avatar.

### Speech Animation with Visemes

The control mechanism includes a Speech Viseme Motility Animation display for speech animation synchronization with speech lip motion, providing visual representations of phonemes (speech sounds) by synchronizing mouth movements with spoken words. It performs phonetically synchronized speech with mouth positions using 21 visemes according to the Viseme/Phoneme event set reference: [System.Speech.Synthesis Namespace SpeechSynthesizer.VisemeReached Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.speech.synthesis.speechsynthesizer.visemereached?view=netframework-4.8).

### Face Detection and Tracking

Facial detection/recognition enables computer vision face tracking/coordination with eye contact and head movement.

- **Face Detection and Tracking**: The integrated video camera inside the head capsule allows for real-time face tracking and coordinated head movement using computer vision.
- **Eyes Gaze Following**: The bicolor LED square pixel matrix mimics the eyes of the robot, dynamically adjusting to follow the observer's gaze, creating an interactive and engaging experience.
- **Neck Orientation**: The neck movement mechanism is synchronized with the face tracking system, enabling the robot's head to orient towards the observer, enhancing the natural interaction between the robot and its user. Neck movement supports motion along both the Y and X axes, allowing for precise head movements.

## System Requirements

The CBM software is designed to be compatible with Microsoft Windows operating systems and requires speech synthesis/recognition references.
The robot control device is powered by a 6V power supply and connects to the computer via a USB serial port.
