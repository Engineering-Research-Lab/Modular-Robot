## Overview

The Modular Robot Head is an innovative, artistic, and industrially designed robotic module that features advanced control algorithms, mechanical engineering, and electronic assembly. It is designed with a transparent face capsule and plastic casing, incorporating a bicolor LED square pixel matrix for displaying emotions and reactions through eyes, nose, and mouth animations. 

### Key Features

1. **Transparent Face Capsule**: 
   - Houses a bicolor LED square pixel matrix for dynamic emotion and reaction representation.
   - Provides an aesthetic and functional design element.

2. **Neck Movement**:
   - Supports 1-degree movement along both Y and X axes, allowing for precise head motions.

3. **Integrated Camera**:
   - Option to include a video camera inside the capsule for face tracking and coordinated head movement.

4. **Comprehensive Library Functions**:
   - Motor control algorithms for smooth and accurate movements.
   - CV (Computer Vision) based control for interactive functionalities.
   - LED animation sequences for expressive outputs.
