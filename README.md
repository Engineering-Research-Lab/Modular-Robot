## Overview

The Modular Robot Head is an innovative, artistic, and industrially designed robotic module that features advanced control algorithms, mechanical engineering, and electronic assembly. It is designed with a transparent face capsule and plastic casing, incorporating a bicolor LED square pixel matrix for displaying emotions and reactions through eyes, nose, and mouth animations. 

### Key Features

1. **Transparent Face Capsule**: 
   - Houses a bicolor LED square pixel matrix for dynamic emotion and reaction representation.
   - Provides an aesthetic and functional design element.

2. **Neck Movement**:
   - Supports movement along both the Y and X axes, allowing for precise head motions.

3. **Integrated Camera**:
   - Option to include a video camera inside the capsule for face tracking and coordinated head movement.

4. **Comprehensive Library Functions**:
   - Motor control algorithms for smooth and accurate movements.
   - CV (Computer Vision) based control for interactive functionalities.
   - LED animation sequences for expressive outputs.

5. **Face Detection and Tracking**:
   - **Face Detection and Tracking**: The integrated camera, combined with advanced computer vision algorithms, allows the robot to detect and track faces in real-time.
   - **Eyes Gaze Following**: The bicolor LED square pixel matrix mimics the eyes of the robot, dynamically adjusting to follow the observer's gaze, creating an interactive and engaging experience.
   - **Neck Orientation**: The neck movement mechanism is synchronized with the face tracking system, enabling the robot's head to orient towards the observer, enhancing the natural interaction between the robot and its user.

6. **Speech Animation with Visemes**:
   - The robot head can animate speech using visemes, providing visual representations of phonemes (speech sounds). This enhances the naturalness of the interaction by synchronizing mouth movements with spoken words.
